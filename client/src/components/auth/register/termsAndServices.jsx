            These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your relationship with the Nfluencer application (the “Service”) operated by Nfluencer (“us”, “we”, or “our”).

            Your access to and use of the Service is based on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.

            By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms and accept all legal consequences.  If you do not agree with these Terms, in whole or in part, do not use the Service.

            1. Subscriptions

            The Service is billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription”).  You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”).  Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Nfluencer cancels it.  You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page.

            A valid payment method, including a credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.  You shall provide Nfluencer will accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information.  By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Nfluencer to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

            2. Fee Changes

            Nfluencer, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions.  Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

            Influencer will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in the Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

            Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

            3. Content

            The Service allows you to post, link, share, and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material (“Content”).  You are responsible for the Content that you post to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

            By posting Content to the Service, you grant us the right and license to use, modify, perform, display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on and through the Service.  You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post, or display on or through the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights.

            You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is yours or you have the right to use it and grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other rights of any person.

            We reserve all rights to block or remove communications or materials that we determine to be: (a) abusive, defamatory, or obscene; (b) fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading; (c) in violation of a copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right of another, or; (d) offensive or otherwise unacceptable to use in our sole discretion.

            You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.

            You agree not to disclose your password to any third party.  You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

            5. Intellectual Property

IN NO EVENT SHALL NFLUENCER’S LIABILITY TO YOU FOR DAMAGES OR LIABILITY OF ANY TYPE EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.

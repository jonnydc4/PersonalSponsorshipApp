Included in this submission is a document that contains bug reports and notes about features/appearance. We plan on continuing to work on this application to fix the bugs
and expand the functionality.

Specifically, one of our main goals was to leverage social media APIs to get influencer profiles and to track the success of the partnerships. To do this, we had to have
a publically available, hosted website. We didn't get to a point where we wanted to do this so we weren't able to implement these integrations.

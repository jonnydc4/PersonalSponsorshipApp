Project Name: NFLUNCR/Influinity

Description: This app is designed to streamline and personalize the process of connecting influencers and companies for sponsored content. As of now, it can be hard for
influencers to find sponsorship deals that align with their content and values, and profit from their content. We can also find similar difficulties on the side of the
companies to find influencers that reach their target audience and have the tools and space necessary to properly showcase their product. On top of that, we live in a
time of innovation and exploration where people are allowed to explore increasingly niche and varying hobbies and interests. Companies are also able to produce an increasing
variety of innovative products which require the buyer to do more research before purchasing the product. Because of this, companies are incentivized to produce the best
product and market it efficiently, and influencers are incentivized to understand their followers and research products they would genuinely need or enjoy having. A lot of time
and money can be saved by helping streamline the process of connecting companies and influencers.

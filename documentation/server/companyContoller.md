### Function Name: `allCompanies`

#### Description
The `allCompanies` function is an asynchronous operation that retrieves all company records from a model layer, typically representing a database. It calls `model.getAllCompanies`, which is expected to return a complete list of companies. This function is generally used for fetching comprehensive information about all companies, suitable for generating reports, populating company directories, or for administrative purposes in managing company data.

#### Parameters
- None

#### Returns
- `Array`: Returns an array containing company records. Each element in the array is an object representing a company. If there are no companies in the database, the function returns an empty array.

#### Raises
- Possible errors might include issues with the model layer's database connection or internal errors within the `model.getAllCompanies` method.

#### Examples
```javascript
const companies = await allCompanies();
```

## Functions:

### Function Name: `validateCompanyId`

#### Description
The `validateCompanyId` function is a synchronous operation designed to validate a given company ID. It checks whether the `companyId` is provided and whether it is a number. The function throws an error if the `companyId` is missing or is not a number, ensuring that only valid numerical IDs are processed. This validation is crucial in operations where a company ID is a required parameter, such as database queries, data manipulation, or business logic operations.

#### Parameters
- `companyId` (`Number` | `Any`): The company ID to be validated. This can be any type, but the function expects a number.

#### Raises
- `Error`: Throws an error if `companyId` is not provided (`'Missing company id for input'`).
- `Error`: Throws an error if `companyId` is not a number (`'Company id must be a number'`).

#### Examples
```javascript
validateCompanyId(123); // Valid case, no error
validateCompanyId(); // Throws 'Missing company id for input'
validateCompanyId('abc'); // Throws 'Company id must be a number'
```



### Function Name: `postJob`

#### Description
The `postJob` function is an asynchronous operation intended to post a new job listing. It uses the `model.createNewJob` method, passing parameters like company ID, job title, job description, and location. This function is essential for adding new job openings to the system. It currently lacks error handling, which is a critical aspect to be implemented (as indicated by the `// todo` comment).

#### Parameters
- `company_id` (`Number`): The identifier of the company posting the job.
- `title` (`String`): The title of the job.
- `description` (`String`): A description of the job, including roles and responsibilities.
- `location` (`String`): The location where the job is based.

#### Returns
- Currently, the function does not return anything. It is advisable to return the `result` of the job posting operation for confirmation or further processing.

#### Raises
- Future implementation should include error handling to manage potential issues such as database connectivity problems, invalid input, or errors from the `model.createNewJob` method.

#### Examples
```javascript
await postJob(1, 'Software Developer', 'Responsible for developing and maintaining software applications', 'New York, NY');
```



### Function Name: `allJobs`

#### Description
The `allJobs` function is an asynchronous operation that retrieves all job listings from the model layer, typically connected to a database. It calls the `model.getAllJobs` method to fetch the complete list of job postings. This function is commonly used for displaying all available jobs, conducting analyses, or managing job data in various business processes.

#### Parameters
- None

#### Returns
- The function returns an array or a collection of job objects, each representing a job record from the database. The structure of these objects depends on the database schema and the implementation of `model.getAllJobs`.

#### Raises
- Errors could arise from the model layer, such as database connectivity issues or problems within the `model.getAllJobs` method itself.

#### Examples
```javascript
const jobs = await allJobs();
```



### Function Name: `allCompanyJobs`

#### Description
The `allCompanyJobs` function is an asynchronous operation that retrieves all job listings associated with a specific company. Initially, it validates the provided `companyId` using the `validateCompanyId` function to ensure it's a valid number. Then, it retrieves the jobs by calling `model.getJobsByCompanyId`. This function is particularly useful for obtaining a targeted list of job postings for a specific company, aiding in company-centric job management and analysis.

#### Parameters
- `companyId` (`Number`): The identifier of the company for which job postings are to be retrieved.

#### Returns
- The function returns a collection of job objects related to the specified company. These objects represent the job records fetched from the database.

#### Raises
- The function will throw an error if `companyId` is not provided or is not a number, as per the validation rules in `validateCompanyId`.
- Additional errors might arise from the model layer, such as database connectivity issues or problems within the `model.getJobsByCompanyId` method.

#### Examples
```javascript
const companyJobs = await allCompanyJobs(123);
```



### Function Name: `handleAllCompanyJobsErrors`

#### Description
The `handleAllCompanyJobsErrors` function is designed to handle and categorize errors specifically for the `allCompanyJobs` function. It maps certain error messages to HTTP status codes, aiding in providing more informative responses in a web service context. The function currently handles two specific error messages, assigning a 400 Bad Request status code to both.

#### Parameters
- `errorMessage` (`String`): The error message that needs to be handled. Expected values are 'Missing company id for input' and 'Company id must be a number'.

#### Returns
- `Object`: An object containing the original `errorMessage` and a corresponding `statusCode`. The `statusCode` is set based on the type of error message provided.

#### Raises
- The function does not explicitly raise errors but it's limited to handling predefined error messages. Any other error message will result in a `statusCode` remaining `undefined`.

#### Examples
```javascript
const errorResponse = handleAllCompanyJobsErrors('Missing company id for input');
// Returns: { errorMessage: 'Missing company id for input', statusCode: 400 }
```
